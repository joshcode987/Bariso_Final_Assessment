# Project: Create a Token
Now the purpose of this project basically shows and provides us the understanding of how to create a token and how everything flows and works. The program or the codes that i'm about to provide to you will help you have a better understanding of how everything funtions.

## Description
The Token.sol is a contract that basically shows us how to mint tokens and also how to burn the tokens based on all the tokens that you have. Let's say you have 1000 tokens and you burn those tokens by 500, then you have 500 tokens left in your possession, but if you burn your token by let's say 2000 but you still have like 500 tokens left then it will not work or basically nothing happens, it is still 500 tokens. This is how tokens are being processed.

## Getting Started
The requirements to be able to work on this is an IDE which is called "Remix - Ethereum IDE". This IDE can be found in any web browsers.

## Executing Program
To execute the program or the code that you have written, go to the "Solidity Compiler" icon then click the auto compile checkbox and then click the Compile Token.sol. Then after go to the "Deploy and Run Transactions" icon then click Diploy, and then look at the bottom and look for the Deployed Contracts then click the down arrow below that. And then from there you will see like the output of your program which is the mint and the burn funtions and of course your tokens that are being processed, but first you must copy the address first which is the account at the top and then paste that address to the mint and burn address and also to the balances.
